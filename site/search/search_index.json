The castle's main content consists of 5 towers: Tower of Pride, Tower of Desire, Tower of Salvation, Tower of Wrath and Tower of Jealousy. Starting from the simplest tower, Tower of Desire, which is often treated as general content. It consists of 200 floors, each having rewards. Enemies share one property each for 10 floors, then property changes.  To move to the next stage, you only need to win the battle. There are 2 additional challenges you can try to complete to gain additional resources. Tower of Wrath and Tower of Jealousy are 100 floors each with neutral property enemies. Moreover, in Tower of Wrath enemies are immune to Physical damage, and in Tower of Jealousy enemies are immune to Magical damage, forcing you to eventually build both teams if you want all rewards. Levels from 41 to 50 are much harder due to reduced buffs by 70% so you really want to have strong teams to complete these two!   \u2003 Tower of Pride, our next tower, differs from previous ones. This tower consists of 6 floors, each having its own property. Each floor consists of 4 normal battles and one boss fight.  Your task in this tower is getting as many points as possible by clearing each floor in the least amount of turns possible, using fully healed characters with the correct properties, and having a costume deal 1 million total damage to the enemies. Based on the calculated total score, you\u2019ll get Ancient Crystals each day. It is important to get max score since this resource is really important in the late game.</p> <p>Tower of Salvation is a unique one. It\u2019s seasonal and resets each 4 weeks. It also  consists of 10 levels, but each level has its own map you need to complete. It can remotely remind you of any roguelike if you have played them. Main gameplay consists of getting useful costumes, winning battles, getting artifacts and, finally, buying stuff in shops.  Winning normal battles give you the option to choose 1 costume out of 4, winning elite and boss battles \u2014 1 artifact out of 4. Artifacts are items that can benefit your whole team by additional effects. Their choice depends on who you have in your roster. You can also combine some of them to get more powerful artifacts. In shops you can buy new and upgrade existing costumes, as well as heal your team and buy powerful artifacts. This tower is so complex it needs a separate video to completely cover it \u2014 if you want the Tower of Salvation complete guide, write down in the comments! </p>"},{"location":"content-packs/fantasia-square/","title":"Fantasia Square","text":"<p>Evil Castle \u2014 one of 5 content packs available to you after clearing Normal difficulty of Story Pack 4.

In this pack you are the Diner owner. Your task is to expand the diner using Glupy Stars, which are generated automatically over time. It\u2019s also a place for small gold, Refining Powder and Elemental Crystals gain. For the gold and Refining Powder, you can press Checkout either in the pack or in the main menu. For the crystals, you need to press Regular Guests in the pack.</p> <p>Maximum level of diner is 30, and you can no longer get stars afterwards. Diner is adjusted to your current time, so you can see the difference in different periods of the day.</p> <p>Sometimes you can see some sort of a bubble on top of npc.

Complete it to get a sweet story, extra backgrounds and, most important, Live2D interaction!

In this mode, your goal is to deal as much damage to a single boss as possible. Your team consists of 20 costumes (not companions!) in a specific order set by you, and you have only one turn. Aside from that, buffs you receive are halved, as you can see here [video?], and the boss effectively has only one tile.  With all that in mind, the general strategy for Last Night is getting 7-8 buffers (both magical and physical), then using 5-7 high chainers and finishing your team with DPS to deal massive damage. Aside from this, any costumes you don\u2019t use also take part in your battle \u2014 but in a form of support bonus. Bonus is counted separately for each unused costume and then added together. To increase bonus, you can upgrade characters in every way possible: gearing them up, leveling up, awakening etc. You should aim for at least 4% bonus per costume. Your main goal should be achieving 110 million \u2014 then you\u2019ll receive 5 Ancient crystals and 5 Awakening Elixir daily with some gold as bonus \u2014 very useful items for your progress. As for crucial costumes which are good in this mode \u2014 Onsen Liberta, Pure White Blessing Refithea from buffers, Promise of Vengeance Lathel, New Hire Nebris as DPS. Last Night is also a good way to show your costumes for team help. Despite lacking information about awakening and potential liberation, it\u2019s still a good way to compactly show your costumes, which often matters above rest when giving advice. To do that, head to the Last Night battle area, hit Replace -&gt; Reset -&gt; Confirm buttons, then sort by Deployed First and you\u2019re good to screenshot your collection.  </p>"},{"location":"content-packs/mirror-wars/","title":"Mirror Wars","text":"<p>Mirror Wars is PvP mode, which is unlocked also after clearing normal difficulty of Story Pack 3. Here, you automatically fight with other players with your team of five. Regardless of the outcome of the battle, you will be granted with exclusive pvp currency \u2014 Medal of the Fighting Spirit.  There are 11 total ranks, with highest being Champion, and lowest being Bronze. The higher you are, the more Medals you receive per battle and more diamonds you get as season rewards.  To start clashing, go to the blood bath in the middle of a room, set up your offense and defense formations, their skill order and you\u2019re ready to go!  To balance things, you get 5 SP at the start in the offense and 6 SP in the defense, so your task is to create a powerful team with as low SP usage as possible, which differs from usual PvE goals and meta. You should not worry about making a good pvp team as a new player since it requires a lot of investment. Aside from this, you get 6 SP every turn, allowing your units to use skills mid battle, however you must set those skills beforehand using \u201cSet Costumes\u201d feature.  Each battle consumes 1 bloody cocktail, with 40 given daily. However 40 battles is really time-consuming, so you can increase cocktail usage up to 10 per fight instead, reducing fight amount significantly. To do that, head to the \u201cRepeated Battle\u201d menu and set the amount of Blood Cocktail consumption to 10 times.  Each PvP season lasts for 1 week, from Monday day reset time to Sunday and has a settlement period of 9 hours before daily reset in which you can no longer attack.</p>"},{"location":"content-packs/path-of-adventure/","title":"Path of Adventure","text":"<p>This pack has the same requirements to be unlocked as Mirror Wars pack \u2014 clearing Normal Difficulty of Story Pack 3. It introduces you a way to gain three very essential resources on a daily basis \u2014 gold, slimes and property crystals.  Gold is obtained via Goblin Ruins, Slimes via Slime Empire, and Crystals through Magic Crystal Caves.  Each of the trials has three difficulties (so basically the same as Story Packs), giving more items for higher difficulty completed.  To complete the difficulty, you need to win 5 regular battles and 1 boss one. After completion, you\u2019re able to enable quick hunt to complete battles on the same difficulty instantly! To do that, just go to the quick hunt menu near the map and pick the desired trial with difficulty. (Note that you cannot do quick hunt from Glupy Diner and Path of Adventure packs) However, you have limited attempts per day, so you can\u2019t just farm indefinitely. For Goblin Ruins and Slime Empire, you are sharing those 60 Cooked Rice with Hunting Grounds per day, and for Magic Crystals Cave, you\u2019re getting 60 Torches daily for your trouble as well. These do not stack each day so make sure to use them all each day!  You are sometimes given extra rice and torches in some events. These are so-called \u201cpaid\u201d versions of these items and will NOT be counted towards those daily 60, so you can save them as much as you need! To use them, just uncheck \u201cUse Free Cooked Rice/Torches\u201d buttons\u201d when you do a quick hunt. Aside from what I said earlier, there are also bonus days. They additionally increase gain of Gold, Slimes or both at the same time from Ruins and Empire respectively. As a new player, you should not waste this bonus and do Gold when only Gold gain is buffed and Slimes when only Slimes gain is buffed.  Usually, your daily routine is one fight in Hunting Grounds (costing you 6 rice) to complete daily mission) 9 fights in Goblin Ruins or Slime Empire, and 10 fights in Caves for needed Crystals.</p>"}]}
