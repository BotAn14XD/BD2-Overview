Starting from the simplest tower, Tower of Desire, which is often treated as general content. It consists of 200 floors, each having rewards. Enemies share one property each for 10 floors, then property changes.  To move to the next stage, you only need to win the battle. There are 2 additional challenges you can try to complete to gain additional resources. Tower of Wrath and Tower of Jealousy are 100 floors each with neutral property enemies. Moreover, in Tower of Wrath enemies are immune to Physical damage, and in Tower of Jealousy enemies are immune to Magical damage, forcing you to eventually build both teams if you want all rewards. Levels from 41 to 50 are much harder due to reduced buffs by 70% so you really want to have strong teams to complete these two!   \u2003 Tower of Pride, our next tower, differs from previous ones. This tower consists of 6 floors, each having its own property. Each floor consists of 4 normal battles and one boss fight.  Your task in this tower is getting as many points as possible by clearing each floor in the least amount of turns possible, using fully healed characters with the correct properties, and having a costume deal 1 million total damage to the enemies. Based on the calculated total score, you\u2019ll get Ancient Crystals each day. It is important to get max score since this resource is really important in the late game.</p> <p>Tower of Salvation is a unique one. It\u2019s seasonal and resets each 4 weeks. It also  consists of 10 levels, but each level has its own map you need to complete. It can remotely remind you of any roguelike if you have played them. Main gameplay consists of getting useful costumes, winning battles, getting artifacts and, finally, buying stuff in shops.  Winning normal battles give you the option to choose 1 costume out of 4, winning elite and boss battles \u2014 1 artifact out of 4. Artifacts are items that can benefit your whole team by additional effects. Their choice depends on who you have in your roster. You can also combine some of them to get more powerful artifacts. In shops you can buy new and upgrade existing costumes, as well as heal your team and buy powerful artifacts.

In this mode, your goal is to deal as much damage to a single boss as possible. Your team consists of 20 costumes (not companions!) in a specific order set by you, and you have only one turn. Aside from that, buffs you receive are halved, as you can see here [video?], and the boss effectively has only one tile.  With all that in mind, the general strategy for Last Night is getting 7-8 buffers (both magical and physical), then using 5-7 high chainers and finishing your team with DPS to deal massive damage. Aside from this, any costumes you don\u2019t use also take part in your battle \u2014 but in a form of support bonus. Bonus is counted separately for each unused costume and then added together. To increase bonus, you can upgrade characters in every way possible: gearing them up, leveling up, awakening etc. You should aim for at least 4% bonus per costume. Your main goal should be achieving 110 million \u2014 then you\u2019ll receive 5 Ancient crystals and 5 Awakening Elixir daily with some gold as bonus \u2014 very useful items for your progress. As for crucial costumes which are good in this mode \u2014 Onsen Liberta, Pure White Blessing Refithea from buffers, Promise of Vengeance Lathel, New Hire Nebris as DPS. Last Night is also a good way to show your costumes for team help. Despite lacking information about awakening and potential liberation, it\u2019s still a good way to compactly show your costumes, which often matters above rest when giving advice. To do that, head to the Last Night battle area, hit Replace -&gt; Reset -&gt; Confirm buttons, then sort by Deployed First and you\u2019re good to screenshot your collection.  </p>"},{"location":"content-packs/mirror-wars/","title":"Mirror Wars","text":""},{"location":"content-packs/mirror-wars/#mirror-wars","title":"Mirror Wars","text":"<p>Mirror Wars is the PvP mode where you fight other players' defense teams. </p> <p>Unlock Requirement</p> <p>Clear Story Pack 3 \"Mist Man\" (Normal Difficulty).</p>"},{"location":"content-packs/mirror-wars/#overview","title":"Overview","text":"<ul> <li>Rankings: There are 11 ranks total (Bronze to Champion).</li> <li>Rewards: You earn  Medals of the Fighting Spirit per battle and  Dia as season rewards.</li> <li>Season Duration: 1 Week (Monday Reset to Sunday).<ul> <li>Note: There is a 9-hour \"Settlement Period\" on Sunday before reset (starting at 15:00 UTC) during which you cannot attack.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Rankings Rank Icon Requirenments Ranking Reward Bronze Victory Points 1000 or above 400  Silver III Victory Points 1050 or above 400  Silver II Victory Points 1100 or above 400  Silver I Victory Points 1200 or above 400  Gold III Victory Points 1300 or above 440  Gold II Victory Points 1400 or above 470  Gold I Victory Points 1500 or above 500  Platinum III Victory Points 1600 or above 540  Platinum II Victory Points 1700 or above 570  Platinum I Victory Points 1800 or above 600  Ruby III Victory Points 1900 or above 640  Ruby II Victory Points 1950 or above 670  Ruby I Victory Points 2000 or above 700  Dia III Victory Points 2100 or above 740  Dia II Victory Points 2200 or above 770  Cheers!

It introduces you a way to gain three very essential resources on a daily basis \u2014 gold, slimes and property crystals.  Gold is obtained via Goblin Ruins, Slimes via Slime Empire, and Crystals through Magic Crystal Caves.  Each of the trials has three difficulties (so basically the same as Story Packs), giving more items for higher difficulty completed.  To complete the difficulty, you need to win 5 regular battles and 1 boss one. After completion, you\u2019re able to enable quick hunt to complete battles on the same difficulty instantly! To do that, just go to the quick hunt menu near the map and pick the desired trial with difficulty. (Note that you cannot do quick hunt from Glupy Diner and Path of Adventure packs) However, you have limited attempts per day, so you can\u2019t just farm indefinitely. For Goblin Ruins and Slime Empire, you are sharing those 60 Cooked Rice with Hunting Grounds per day, and for Magic Crystals Cave, you\u2019re getting 60 Torches daily for your trouble as well. These do not stack each day so make sure to use them all each day!  You are sometimes given extra rice and torches in some events. These are so-called \u201cpaid\u201d versions of these items and will NOT be counted towards those daily 60, so you can save them as much as you need! To use them, just uncheck \u201cUse Free Cooked Rice/Torches\u201d buttons\u201d when you do a quick hunt. Aside from what I said earlier, there are also bonus days. They additionally increase gain of Gold, Slimes or both at the same time from Ruins and Empire respectively. As a new player, you should not waste this bonus and do Gold when only Gold gain is buffed and Slimes when only Slimes gain is buffed.  Usually, your daily routine is one fight in Hunting Grounds (costing you 6 rice) to complete daily mission) 9 fights in Goblin Ruins or Slime Empire, and 10 fights in Caves for needed Crystals.</p>"}]}
