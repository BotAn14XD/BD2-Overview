# Mirror Wars

Mirror Wars is the PvP mode where you fight other players' defense teams.

* **Rankings:** There are **11 ranks** total (Bronze to Champion).
* **Rewards:** You earn **{{ pvp_medals }}** per battle and **{{ dias }}** as season rewards.

## Combat Rules
Mirror Wars works differently than most of PvE.

* **Offense:** You start with **5 SP**.
* **Defense:** You start with **6 SP**.
* **SP Regen:** You gain **6 SP** every turn.

!!! tip "Strategy Tip"
    Because you have limited starting SP, you must build a team with **low SP costs**. 
    
    You cannot use your expensive "nuke" skills on Turn 1 like you do in Story Mode!

??? abstract "Preemptive Costume Mechanic Explained"
    Some costumes have the ability to be used preemptive. They are used on so-called **0th turn**, which will still take SP, leaving you with less SP for following turns. 

    For example, using maxed **Comeback Idol Granhildr** preemptively on defense will give your team 6 (Initial) - 5 (Costume Preemptive) + 6 (Turn 2 Gain) = 7 SP on Turn 2. 

## Bloody Cocktails
Each fight costs entry tickets called **{{ cocktails }}**

!!! info "{{ cocktails }}"
    
    * **Daily Refill:** 40 Cocktails (Resets at {{ time('00:00') }})
    * **Cost:** 1 per fight
    * **Batch:** Up to 10x per fight

    * **Other Sources**: Events, Shop (40 {{ cocktails_pic }} for 170 {{ dias_pic }} )

!!! warning "Time Saver"
    40 battles a day is time-consuming! Use the **Repeat Battle** menu to set Cocktail consumption to **10 times**. 
    
    * You will fight once, but get rewards (and spend cocktails) as if you fought 10 times.
    * This, however, does not increase Victory Points compared to 1 battle.
