## Combat Rules
Mirror Wars works differently than PvE.

* **Offense:** You start with **5 SP**.
* **Defense:** You start with **6 SP**.
* **SP Regen:** You gain **6 SP** every turn.

!!! tip "Strategy Tip"
    Because you have limited starting SP, you must build a team with **low SP costs**. You cannot use your expensive "nuke" skills on Turn 1 like you do in Story Mode!

## The Economy (Bloody Cocktails)
Each fight costs entry tickets called **Bloody Cocktails**.

| **Daily Refill** | 40 Cocktails |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Cost per Fight** | 1 Cocktail |
| **Batch Battle** | Up to 10x per fight |

!!! warning "Time Saver"
    40 battles a day is time-consuming! Use the **Repeated Battle** menu to set Cocktail consumption to **10 times**. You will fight once, but get rewards (and spend cocktails) as if you fought 10 times.
