Glupy Diner is the last content pack. In this pack you are the Diner owner. Your task is to expand the diner using Glupy Stars, which are generated automatically over time. It’s also a place for small gold, Refining Powder and Elemental Crystals gain. For the gold and Refining Powder, you can press Checkout either in the pack or in the main menu. For the crystals, you need to press Regular Guests in the pack.

Maximum level of diner is 30, and you can no longer get stars afterwards. Diner is adjusted to your current time, so you can see the difference in different periods of the day.

Sometimes you can see some sort of a bubble on top of npc. If you click it, you can interact with npc and get Deco Coins, which are needed for My Room feature.   
It has a cap of 20 per day, and you usually get 3 or 10 coins per bubble.

There are 2 types of guests in Diner: regular, which give crystals and 100 gems once they appear three times in total, and special. 

To get special guests, you need to own specific costumes. You can check the list of these in-game using GluTalk in the same pack. If you own the costume, Special Guest will appear. Upon interacting with them, you’ll get the story with 10 encounters. Complete it to get a sweet story, extra backgrounds and, most important, Live2D interaction! I won’t spoil much so try it yourself
