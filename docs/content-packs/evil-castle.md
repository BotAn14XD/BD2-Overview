Evil Castle — one of 5 content packs available to you after clearing Normal difficulty of Story Pack 4. The castle's main content consists of 5 towers: Tower of Pride, Tower of Desire, Tower of Salvation, Tower of Wrath and Tower of Jealousy.
Starting from the simplest tower, Tower of Desire, which is often treated as general content. It consists of 200 floors, each having rewards. Enemies share one property each for 10 floors, then property changes. 
To move to the next stage, you only need to win the battle. There are 2 additional challenges you can try to complete to gain additional resources.
Tower of Wrath and Tower of Jealousy are 100 floors each with neutral property enemies. Moreover, in Tower of Wrath enemies are immune to Physical damage, and in Tower of Jealousy enemies are immune to Magical damage, forcing you to eventually build both teams if you want all rewards. Levels from 41 to 50 are much harder due to reduced buffs by 70% so you really want to have strong teams to complete these two!    
Tower of Pride, our next tower, differs from previous ones. This tower consists of 6 floors, each having its own property. Each floor consists of 4 normal battles and one boss fight. 
Your task in this tower is getting as many points as possible by clearing each floor in the least amount of turns possible, using fully healed characters with the correct properties, and having a costume deal 1 million total damage to the enemies. Based on the calculated total score, you’ll get Ancient Crystals each day. It is important to get max score since this resource is really important in the late game.

Tower of Salvation is a unique one. It’s seasonal and resets each 4 weeks. It also  consists of 10 levels, but each level has its own map you need to complete. It can remotely remind you of any roguelike if you have played them. Main gameplay consists of getting useful costumes, winning battles, getting artifacts and, finally, buying stuff in shops. 
Winning normal battles give you the option to choose 1 costume out of 4, winning elite and boss battles — 1 artifact out of 4.
Artifacts are items that can benefit your whole team by additional effects. Their choice depends on who you have in your roster. You can also combine some of them to get more powerful artifacts.
In shops you can buy new and upgrade existing costumes, as well as heal your team and buy powerful artifacts. This tower is so complex it needs a separate video to completely cover it — if you want the Tower of Salvation complete guide, write down in the comments!
